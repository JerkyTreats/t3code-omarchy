# Upstream Intake `v0.0.21 -> v0.0.22`

## Goal

Define the intake plan for integrating upstream `v0.0.21 -> v0.0.22` into the fork while preserving the protected fork surfaces described in `patch.md`.

## Release Shape

This release line is very large and crosses multiple fork-owned seams at once.

It mixes:

- multi-provider shell and provider-instance flows
- hosted frontend plus remote connectivity substrate
- Tailscale and SSH environment support
- pluggable VCS and multi-host source control providers
- large shell and mobile UI churn
- diff UX expansion and markdown stability work
- startup and memory reduction work

That makes `v0.0.21 -> v0.0.22` the largest remaining stable-parity release line after the earlier `.19` branch base.

## Protected Surfaces Touched

- `F1` branding and release identity
- `F4` composer draft autonomy and composer chrome
- `F5` Git panel isolation from draft ownership
- `F6` fork first GitHub identity resolution
- `F7` local branch, worktree, and promotion workflow
- `F8` plan-aware sidebar and activity status cues
- `F9` plan markdown preview and markdown rendering behavior

## Intake Summary

### Adopt

These changes are high value and low conflict with fork-owned behavior:

- startup and memory reduction work
- provider runtime hardening and instance-registry hydration
- server exposure and remote endpoint safety fixes
- markdown highlight stability
- focused mobile correctness fixes
- stale WebSocket lifecycle filtering
- diff focus-ring and dialog clipping fixes

### Adapt

These changes should be taken, but only through fork seams:

- multi-provider shell and provider-instance settings flows
- source control provider discovery and repository service
- VCS driver foundation and status broadcaster
- hosted frontend, Tailscale, and SSH shell integration
- `ChatView`, `Sidebar`, `ChatMarkdown`, and route-shell changes
- collapsible file diffs and whitespace toggle behavior
- source control presentation across GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, and Azure DevOps

### Reject

No major theme in this release line should be rejected wholesale.

Still reject during merge resolution:

- any source control selection logic that stops preferring the fork repository context for user-facing GitHub flows
- any VCS abstraction that weakens fork promotion semantics or worktree guarantees
- any shell change that breaks draft autonomy, screenshot flows, or protected markdown preview behavior
- any branding or hosted-flow change that removes Omarchy identity

## File-Level Intake

### Startup And Runtime Efficiency

Status:

- `adopt`
- current branch status: `complete`

Primary upstream work:

- `aca0fa4e`
- `dbebc387`
- `35822884`

Files:

- `apps/server/src/provider`
- `apps/server/src/ws.ts`
- `apps/desktop/src/main.ts`

Why:

- these changes align directly with repository priorities for performance, reliability, and predictable behavior under reconnect
- they do not require product-semantic changes by themselves

### Source Control And VCS Foundation

Status:

- `adapt`
- current branch status: `complete`

Primary upstream work:

- `6d7fe2ee`
- `0ce7e56e`
- `91a03e07`
- `d7969264`

Files:

- `apps/server/src/sourceControl`
- `apps/server/src/vcs`
- `packages/contracts/src/sourceControl.ts`
- `packages/contracts/src/vcs.ts`
- `apps/web/src/sourceControlPresentation.ts`
- `apps/web/src/routes/settings.source-control.tsx`

Why:

- the new foundation is valuable and will likely reduce future drift
- it overlaps directly with `F6` and `F7`
- the fork must preserve GitHub-first user context and guarded Git workflow behavior while adopting the broader substrate

Required fork behavior to preserve:

- fork-first GitHub identity for user-facing repo and issue context
- guarded promotion, backup branch, and safe cleanup semantics
- no coupling between source control settings actions and active draft state

Recommended merge method:

1. Adopt contracts and server substrate first.
2. Reconcile GitHub identity decisions at the final repository-selection seam.
3. Reconcile UI presentation after server source-control discovery is stable.

Current branch outcome:

- contracts, server substrate, and web settings exposure landed in `168beb8f`
- GitHub provider registration landed in `be08033f`
- default branch resolution moved to the registry in `fe8f2145`
- fork clone URL lookup moved to the registry in `e0c35a8f`
- PR resolve and local checkout moved to the registry in `19647490`
- open PR lookup, duplicate detection, and PR creation moved to the registry in `c6667bcc`
- provider capability presentation landed in `6f7e8c77`

### Multi-Provider Shell And Settings

Status:

- `adapt`
- current branch status: `partial`

Primary upstream work:

- `08e6d4cf`
- `460d9c3e`

Files:

- `apps/web/src/components/settings`
- `apps/web/src/providerInstances.ts`
- `apps/web/src/lib/providerReactQuery.ts`
- `apps/web/src/components/chat/ModelPickerSidebar.tsx`
- `apps/web/src/components/Sidebar.tsx`
- `apps/web/src/components/ChatView.tsx`
- `apps/web/src/routes/settings.tsx`

Why:

- this is the user-visible control plane for the new provider stack
- it sits directly on top of fork-owned shell, settings, and sidebar behavior

Required fork behavior to preserve:

- shell layout stays fork-owned
- composer autonomy remains intact
- plan cues and preview access remain visible
- provider UI does not flatten fork-specific workflow affordances

### Remote Connectivity And Hosted Frontend

Status:

- `adapt`
- current branch status: `complete`

Primary upstream work:

- `3772fa12`

Files:

- `apps/desktop/src/serverExposure.ts`
- `apps/desktop/src/sshEnvironment.ts`
- `apps/desktop/src/tailscaleEndpointProvider.ts`
- `apps/web/src/routes/pair.tsx`
- `packages/tailscale`
- `packages/ssh`

Why:

- the remote substrate is useful, but it changes how the product connects and advertises endpoints
- that has product and desktop implications beyond routine server hardening

Required fork behavior to preserve:

- Omarchy identity across desktop and hosted surfaces
- safe local-first behavior for existing desktop usage
- no regression in local auth, screenshots, or route assumptions

Current branch outcome:

- substrate checkpoint landed in `168beb8f`
- friendly invalid pairing token handling landed in `74fdf3f7`
- environment metadata helpers landed in `ca39a036`
- saved environment persistence and remote actions landed in `adc59cc9`
- discovered SSH host connect flow landed in `c673470f`
- hosted pairing route flow landed in `a9120e15`
- forget, reconnect, and manual pairing-link flows landed in `e096f207`, `97824542`, `47bc4e94`, and `00d29214`
- active saved-remote boot, connect, disconnect, and hosted activation landed in `96131a7e`

Remote and hosted completion criteria now satisfied on branch:

- desktop SSH discovery can create and reconnect saved environments
- manual pairing links can save and activate remote environments
- hosted pairing can save and activate a backend, then open the app against that backend
- active remote environments can boot the app through saved bearer credentials and refreshed WebSocket tokens
- disconnect returns the app to the local primary backend on reload
- local-first desktop fallback remains intact when active remote bootstrap fails

### Shell, Diff, And Markdown Presentation

Status:

- `adapt`
- current branch status: `partial`

Primary upstream work:

- `f4c9418d`
- `f7748a0d`
- `623e471a`
- `92e340d8`
- `f54f4385`

Files:

- `apps/web/src/components/ChatMarkdown.tsx`
- `apps/web/src/components/ChatView.tsx`
- `apps/web/src/components/Sidebar.tsx`
- `apps/web/src/components/AppSidebarLayout.tsx`
- route files under `apps/web/src/routes`

Why:

- this release line changes diff behavior, mobile shell defaults, and markdown rendering in the same protected surfaces already owned by the fork
- these are high-value UX changes, but they must be integrated under existing fork shell and preview contracts

Required fork behavior to preserve:

- fullscreen in-memory plan preview behavior
- readable wide markdown surfaces
- fork-owned diff and panel access behavior
- composer ownership and screenshot controls

## Execution Ledger

Completed upstream slices on this branch:

- runtime and reconnect hardening
  - upstream coverage: `aca0fa4e`, `dbebc387`, `35822884`
  - local checkpoints: `168beb8f`

- source control and VCS completion
  - upstream coverage: `6d7fe2ee`, `0ce7e56e`, `91a03e07`, `d7969264`
  - local checkpoints: `168beb8f`, `be08033f`, `fe8f2145`, `e0c35a8f`, `19647490`, `c6667bcc`, `6f7e8c77`

- remote and hosted completion
  - upstream coverage: `3772fa12`, `8f50ca8e`
  - local checkpoints: `168beb8f`, `74fdf3f7`, `ca39a036`, `adc59cc9`, `c673470f`, `a9120e15`, `e096f207`, `97824542`, `47bc4e94`, `00d29214`, `96131a7e`

Still open in `0.22`:

- broader provider-instance shell completion for `08e6d4cf` and `460d9c3e`
- broader shell, diff, markdown, and mobile intake for `f4c9418d`, `f7748a0d`, `623e471a`, `92e340d8`, and `f54f4385`
- final release-line reconciliation after those UI slices land

## Implementation Order

1. complete startup and runtime efficiency work
2. complete source control and VCS substrate
3. complete remote connectivity and hosted flows
4. finish multi-provider settings and shell state
5. finish diff, mobile shell, and markdown presentation changes

## Verification Focus

- startup time and reconnect behavior improve without breaking local workflow
- source control discovery preserves fork GitHub identity and promotion semantics
- provider-instance settings do not regress shell or composer ownership
- hosted and remote features do not disturb local-first desktop behavior
- diff, markdown, and mobile shell changes preserve protected plan and preview flows

## Bottom Line

`v0.0.21 -> v0.0.22` should be integrated in staged slices with explicit seam ownership.

The source control and remote-hosted lanes are now complete on branch.

The remaining high-risk seam is the protected shell and presentation lane, plus the remaining provider-instance UI completion work.
